# ElectricalArchitecture

## A pet project to explore a lightweight structure to perform Electrical Architecture design for electric vehicle platforms. 
The options, workflows, and features are based on my personal experiences with these types of software, particularly in handling the "corner-cases" where the software fails or the rigidity of the allowed user-interaction framework requires complicated manual fixes in order to solve a problem.

### 2019-10-01
Nothing published yet as I continue to explore frameworks and come to a resolution about how much to automate vs how much should be manual decisions by the user.
